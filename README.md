Welcome to the repository for the Hierarchical Engine for Large-scale Infrastructure Co-Simulation (HELICS).  HELICS is a Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium ([GMLC](https://gridmod.labworks.org/)) project supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Offices of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability ([OE](https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity-delivery-and-energy-reliability)) and Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy ([EERE](https://www.energy.gov/eere/office-energy-efficiency-renewable-energy)).

Energy systems and their associated information and communication technology systems are becoming increasingly intertwined. As a result, effectively designing, analyzing, and implementing modern energy systems increasingly relies on advanced modeling that simultaneously captures both the cyber and physical domains in combined simulations. HELICS is a layered, high-performance, co-simulation framework that builds on the collective experience of multiple national labs. It is designed to increase scalability and portability in modeling advanced features of highly integrated power system and cyber-physical energy systems.

# Getting Started
We've created a series of roughly 10-minute mini-tutorial videos that discuss various design topics, concepts, and interfaces, including how to use the tool. They can be found on our YouTube channel [here](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-Tutorial).   

Tutorial models can also be found on the [repository](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-Tutorial).




# Documentation

TODO (docs).

Additionally, our initial requirements document can be found [here](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/specification-doc/blob/master/src/specification.md), which describes a number of our design considerations.

# Publications

TODO.
