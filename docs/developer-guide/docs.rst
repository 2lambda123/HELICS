Generating Documentation
========================

You will need the following Python packages.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install recommonmark
    pip install sphinx
    pip install ghp-import
    pip install breathe
    pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
    pip install nbsphinx

You will also need doxygen.

You can then type ``make doxygen html`` to create the documentation locally.
